# Fiat 500e Port Replacement
## How I replaced a broken charge port on 2015 Fiat 500e in May 2021
Into our ownership of a used 500e, the charge port suddenly became loose when connecting the charge cable.  Upon closer inspection, we could see where it had been previously broken and glued.  That repair failed.  Looking at 500e forum, it was clear that dealership repair was outrageously expensive but that there was a fairly straightforward DIY fix.  Fortunately, the repair does not require any major change to the electrical lines.  It is just removing the current electrical pins from the broken plastic port housing and placing them in a new plastic port housing.

A search on eBay for a replacement charge port yielded a hit for a port with instructions that matched the process mentioned as successful in the forum.  I'm documenting it for my personal future reference.

If you chose to follow, your actions are your own.  I can not be held responsible for any outcomes of your actions.  You assume all the risks associated with automotive and electrical repair.

## Process
The process I used followed the supplied instructions.  They were detailed and complete but contained no drawings or images for guidance.  I'm documenting my process here for better reference

### Prep and Access
- Disconnect 12V battery
- Set parking brake and chalk driver rear wheel
- Pop hubcap cover on passenger rear wheel
- Loosen lug bolts (17mm)
- Jack car
  - Borrowed scissor jack from my Mazda
    - Located it surrounding pinch weld in the rear.  It barely clears the fat weld and I had to avoid bent areas from someone else's previous poor attempts
  - Lumber stack under shock mount for safety stand
- Remove bolts and wheel
  - Lowered jack slightly to place partial weight onto lumber stack to avoid potential drops
- Remove fender well cover attachments
  - 3 plastic nuts on center interior side
  - 3 screws on rear exterior side
- Remove fender well cover
  - Disconnect rear catch
  - Pull interior side off rear-most stud, then center stud
  - Pull exterior side from under fender lip working from rear forward until it became too hard
  - Pull interior side off front-most stud.  This took some work.
  - Pull remaining exterior side from under fender lip.  This also took some work and pulling, but it eventually popped loose
  - Remove fender well cover from the wheel area which exposes the electrical leads and port

### Port Removal
- Remove plastic port surround
  - Use plastic pry tool to avoid scratching paint.  There are two connecting tabs on the backside to the left and the right of the center hole
- Remove 4 nuts from attachment plate
- Remove outside attachment plate
  - This took some prying on ours because of glue buildup from previous repair
- Push port through hole into fender well
- Pry plastic binding post away that connects port to inside attachment plate
